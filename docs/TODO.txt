----

* ``_fromDatabase`` currently doesn't support IDs that don't fit into
  the normal naming scheme.  It should do so.  You can still use
  ``_idName`` with ``_fromDatabase``.
* More databases supported.  There has been interest and some work in
  the progress for Oracle, Sybase, and MS-SQL support.
* Better transaction support -- right now you can use transactions
  for the database, but the object isn't transaction-aware, so
  non-database persistence won't be able to be rolled back.
* Optimistic locking and other techniques to handle concurrency.
* Profile of SQLObject performance, so that I can identify bottlenecks.
* Increase hooks with FormEncode (unreleased) validation and form
  generation package, so SQLObject classes (read: schemas) can be
  published for editing more directly and easily.
* Automatic joins in select queries.
* More kinds of joins, and more powerful join results (closer to how
  `select` works).
